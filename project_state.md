## Pending tasks
- [ ] Phase 1: Carousel Card Refinement (**Vertical & Rectangular**)
- [ ] Phase 1: Fix BrandCarousel Mobile Overlap (Current implementation collides on <480px width)
- [ ] Phase 1: Mobile Breakpoints Audit
- [ ] Phase 1: Accessibility (Aria-labels, etc.)
- [ ] Implement image optimization system.
- [ ] Conduct performance (Lighthouse) audit.

## Known issues
- **BrandCarousel Mobile Overlap:** The left/right carousel centers at 0 and 100% width causing image overlap on very narrow screens. Reverted to stable desktop version for now.

## RECAP log
- **2026-03-31**: Initial project kickoff. Read `context.md`, defined Phase 1 goals, and initialized `project_state.md`. Initialized Next.js 16.2.1 + Tailwind v4 project and configured Pharma Teal theme. Verified initial render via browser subagent. Committed to `feature/scaffolding-phase1`.

### RECAP — 2026-04-03 02:22
- **Built**:       Full-Page Scroll Snapping logic (Lenis-integrated Wheel Controller). High-fidelity `TypewriterHeading` component.
- **Improved**:    Replaced placeholder blank cards with AI-generated high-fidelity pharma/logistics imagery. 
- **Refined**:     Bidirectional text animations (un-typing on up-scroll). 
- **Plan**:        Tomorrow we'll refine the carousel cards: **vertical and rectangular** form factors.
- **Motion Shift**: Cards will only rotate/angle slightly, letting the 360-degree orbital carousel drive the spatial reveal.
- **Left off at**: `SmoothScroller.tsx` (Finalized Snap Logic).
